The only process in the ecosystem that holds a key authorized in
`AIMarketEscrow.authorizedHubs`. It exists so that the hub does not.

**Address:** `0xBE0bBE44cceCfEb048dd53f601C37525a3D6C5f1` ·
**Chain:** Base mainnet (8453) · **Escrow:** `0x12Db8FAC81E5999D2f2087B79e38951571562CF2`
· **Host:** the skopos box (`skopos-host`), reached from the hub host over a reverse SSH
tunnel. Never the hub box: sharing a machine would make "the key never enters the hub
process" a sentence rather than a boundary.

## What it will sign

Exactly one thing: a canonical `debitChannel(bytes32,uint256,bytes32,uint256,bytes)` call,
selector `0xf7becd80`, to the one pinned escrow, on the one pinned chain, with `value == 0`.
Nothing else — not `settleChannel`, not an ERC-20 `transfer`, not `setHubAuthorization`, not
a contract creation, not on Sepolia.

The authority for the **amount** is not the hub. It is the depositor's EIP-712 signature,
re-verified here against channel state this service read itself, with **our own address**
substituted for the `hub` field — exactly as the contract does. A signature minted for
another hub, at another nonce, or by anyone who is not the channel's depositor, is refused.

## Why a policy signer rather than a key in the hub

`AIMARKET_ESCROW_SUBMIT_STRATEGY=external` moves the key out of the hub process, and on its
own that buys very little: the hub posts `{to, data, chainId, gas, value}` and a naive signer
signs whatever it is handed. A compromised hub with the bearer token would then ask for
`USDC.transfer(attacker, everything)` and the key would sign it. So the value is entirely in
the refusals, and those are enumerated as rules R1–R26 in `escrow_signer/policy.py`,
`ledger.py` and `calldata.py`.

The residual risk that no signer can close, stated plainly: **a compromised hub can still
collect, without delivering service, everything buyers have already validly signed for, up to
the velocity caps.** Every field the contract checks is covered by the depositor's digest, so
a signature the depositor really produced is indistinguishable from the row the mirror wanted.
It shrinks with smaller caps and with buyers signing per invocation rather than in advance.

## Deploy

```
scp -r escrow-signer/ signer-host:/root/escrow-signer/
cp .env.example .env      # on the host, chmod 600, fill in the key and the token
docker compose up -d --build
curl -s localhost:9500/health     # {"ok":true,"ready":true,...}
```

Then, on the **hub** host:

```
cp deploy/escrow-signer-tunnel.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable --now escrow-signer-tunnel
curl -s localhost:9500/health     # the tunnel, not the service

cd /root/claudecode/aicom && ./scripts/deploy_hub_rebuild.sh --no-build \
  --set AIMARKET_ESCROW_SUBMIT_STRATEGY=external \
  --set AIMARKET_ESCROW_SIGNER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9500/sign \
  --set AIMARKET_ESCROW_SIGNER_TOKEN="$(cat /root/.escrow-signer-token)" \
  --set AIMARKET_ESCROW_SUBMIT_CONFIRM=i-understand-this-moves-funds
```

`plan` first, always — it builds the real calldata and runs it through `eth_call` against
live state, so it answers "would this be accepted right now?" without a transaction existing:

```
docker exec modelmarket-hub python -m aimarket_hub.escrow_bridge.cli plan
docker exec modelmarket-hub python -m aimarket_hub.escrow_bridge.cli submit --yes
```

The fourth gate is deliberate: nothing broadcasts from the request path in any strategy, so
regular settlement is a timer on the hub host running `submit --yes`, not a background thread.

## Operating it

- `GET /health` — readiness, the address, and why it is refusing if it is. No ledger write.
- `GET /status` — the caps in force and the ledger's state.
- `GET /receipt/<receipt_id>` — the authoritative view of what this service broadcast. The
  hub's `confirm()` treats a returned hash as proof; this is where that can be checked
  against something that did not come from the same answer.
- It boots into a **refusing** state and stays there until the books verify, the chain agrees
  it is an authorized hub, the domain separator matches, and every unresolved row is
  classified from chain evidence. A stalled queue is better than an unmetered signature.

**The address is also the payee.** `settleChannel` pays `ch.hub`, which is this key, so
revenue accumulates here rather than in the treasury. Sweeping it is a separate, deliberate
operator action.

## Caps

All in integer USDC base units (6 dp). Every one is required — a missing, zero or negative
value refuses to start, and "no limit" must be spelled `unlimited` and is announced at every
boot. There is deliberately **no per-pass cap**: no pass id exists in the wire format, and any
"pass" inferred from idle gaps can be reset by pacing requests. Per-pass stays in the hub.

The count caps are not redundant with the dollar caps: receipt burning and nonce grinding cost
nothing in USDC and are bounded only by counts. `SIGNER_CAP_FEE_WEI_24H` is separate again,
because the dollar caps are denominated in the token while the drain vector is the key's ETH.

## Tests

```
python -m pytest escrow-signer/tests -q      # 95 tests
```

`tests/test_wire.py` imports the hub's own `ExternalSigner` and drives it against a real
socket — including the assertion that **no route ever answers 3xx**, because `urllib` follows
redirects with the `Authorization` header attached, which would turn a trailing slash into
token disclosure. `tests/test_policy.py` is the refusal table; every case asserts that nothing
was signed and nothing was broadcast, not merely that a status code came back.
